## Introduction
This modpack is designed for [Dylans Discord] Community, but you can play it in Single Player too.

This pack guides you through various mods which are only unlocked after a certain level of progress (Stages),
You will be accompanied through these chapters by a quest book,
what helpes beginners to understand how to work with several mods.

The four main stages leads the players from the Stone Age over the the Industrial Revolution
and later up to the stars and alien technology that allows a lot of automation.
Byside the technology mods, the world offers the chance to explore some other dimensions
filled with magic and adventures

And maybe you will find some unique items too.
